    "# 1. Discover Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter is only about theory but it will give you some knowledge about Python, its history and how to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computer and programming\n",
    "\n",
    "You know for sure that computer communicate with the binary language (00111000110101 for example means absolutely nothing). And for you to interact with your computer, it would be lame if you have to give him instruction with only 0 and 1. Imagine the time you'll need just to close the internet window here. That's why humanity decided to get some programming language, to simplify the writing and the communication with computer. It will translate for you in binary what you want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## History\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was invented in 1991 (yeah 30 years ago!) by Guido van Rossum who worked first on a Macintosh version until the creation of the Python Software Foundation in 2001. The name comes from the famous humorists _Monty Python_. \n",
    "\n",
    "## An interpreted language \n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison with others languages like C/C++ which are compiled languages, Python is interpreted. This means that the code you write is executed in live when you push the _Run_ button. Compiled languages need to be translate into your computer language before be executed. So, everytime you make a little change, you have to compile your whole script again before launching it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages are that Python code is easier to run, universal (that's not totally true but you can give your code to a Linux, MacOS user without be disturbed with the comptability).\n",
    "\n",
    "Drawbacks are that it's faster to run a compiled software than a Python software even if with the growing of computer speed, it tends not to be faster anymore. And also you have to install the right version of Python everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your own knowledge, in terms of speed :\n",
    "Matlab is the slowest, Python faster and [Julia](https://julialang.org/) the fastest. We're not here to discuss about Julia but perhaps next year ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uses of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is powerful for several reasons. He's easy to learn, and when you acquired the basis, you can create a lot of things really fast. And to help you, you have a ton of libraries already written and always updated. The power of this language is also found in the number of users. As it's well-known and well-spread around the world, you have also a big community to ask questions and already a lot of answers for litteraly anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Python you can create:\n",
    "1. little __script__ to accomplish a specific task on your computer\n",
    "2. whole softwares like games, text editor, audio software, mail service\n",
    "3. Suite of softwares which work altogether\n",
    "    \n",
    "With the libraries, you can :\n",
    "1. create graphical interface\n",
    "2. do some networking\n",
    "3. speak with you OS\n",
    "4. work with seismic data...\n",
    "    \n",
    "I'm not here to give you all the knowledge, BUT once you understand how it works, with some small research and time, you can go further alone. Yeah I speak of letting my students alone and it's only 15 minutes we began... children grow up so fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Versions of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major versions of Python currently : Python 2 and Python 3. All the Linux OS contain at least Python 2. But since 2020, Python 2 is deprecated. That means that there won't be any updates anymore. Oh no, what will we do? Learn Python 3 directly. There are some changements between these two versions because a lot of things were useless in Python 2 and the writing sometimes confusing, not _clean_ enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you have a script written with Python 2, you have to adapt it to Python 3 to run it correctly. That's not the case between versions of Python 3 (like Python 3.5 and Python 3.9). Your code will always be understandable if you use a a more recent version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's go install it !\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, go on the website https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click on _Download Python 3.9.1_. Then install it, follow instructions and you'll see in the Start Menu: Python 3.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MacOS\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Windows, First of all, go on the website https://www.python.org/downloads/ and click on _Download Python 3.9.1_. Open the `.dmg` file and then click on `Python.mpkg`. Follow instructions and it's done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux my friend ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The last stable version is here : https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/Python-3.9.1.tgz \n",
    "Then, open a terminal and `cd` in the folder you download it.\n",
    "1. Unzip the tarball with the command `sudo tar -xzf Python-3.9.1.tgz`. Perhaps it will differ from a Linux version to another.\n",
    "2. `cd Python-3.9.1`\n",
    "3. Execute the script configure writing `sudo ./configure` and wait.\n",
    "4. Compile Python 3.9 writing `sudo make`and then `sudo make install`\n",
    "\n",
    "## PyCharm\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a big software to code in Python which is PyCharm. For the beginning, we could use just the command line that we installed just before but we will take directly good habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download with this link : https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2020.3.3.exe and then install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### MacOS\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download with this link : https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2020.3.3.dmg and then install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download with this link : https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2020.3.3.tar.gz and then :\n",
    "1. `sudo tar xzf pycharm-community-2020.3.3.tar.gz -C /opt/`\n",
    "2. `cd /opt/pycharm-community-2020.3.3/bin`\n",
    "3. `sh pycharm.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Launch PyCharm for the first time and it can take some time. After I will show to you what's possible with it."
