    "\n",
    "What is inheritance? Inheritance is one of the most used concepts in object-oriented programming. At first you'll ask yourself \"What the fuck am I learning?\" and after you'll be like \"Why the fuck am I learning this?\" and finally \"Why the fuck didn't know about that before?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "And here the guide to go through it ... we will begin with examples out of ``obspy``.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a concept where you can declare that one of your class will be built on the model of another one which is called the __Base Class__. If a class ``Child`` inherits from the class `Mother`, the objects created on the model of the `Child` will have access to the __methods__ and __attributes__ of the class `Mother`. This `Child` class is called __Derived Class__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to add some features to our Base Class like other methods and attributes which will get some great make up on it. The Derived Class can also redefined some methods in the Base Class to adapt to your personal use (print other stuffs, change figures ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "Buut let's start at the beginning with an example. We have a class `Animal` where we can create ... animals. When we define an animal, they have attributes (like the diet: meat or plants) and methods (like eat, drink, shout).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can define the class `Dog` which inherits from the `Animal` class, so it has its methods and attributes. Why `Dog` from `Animal` and not the contrary :\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Dog` inherits from `Animal` because a dog is an animal ;\n",
    "- `Animal` doesn't inherit from `Dog` because an animal is not a dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the same model : an car is a vehicule. So a `Car` can inherits from `Vehicule`. Now we can write a little bit of code!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The single inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "We oppose __single inheritance__ to __multiple inheritance__ that we won't see together. If it interests you later, contact me and I will write for you a little something about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the syntax. We will define a ``BaseClass`` and a ``DerivedClass`` which inherits from ``BaseClass``."
