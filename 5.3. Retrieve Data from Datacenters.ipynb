    "Obspy is the worldwide library for seismic data manipulation in Python. It includes nearly everything you need to work properly at the institute. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to search for something into Obspy, the website is really well documented [ObsPy Documentation](http://docs.obspy.org/) and you will find for sure the love of your life on it.\n",

    "\n",
    "The core functionality of ObsPy is provided by..\n",
    "\n",
    "- ..the most important base classes..\n",
    "  * the **`UTCDateTime`** class handles time information.\n",
    "  * the **`Stream`**/**`Trace`** classes handle waveform data.\n",
    "  * the **`Catalog`**/**`Event`**/... classes handle event metadata (modelled after QuakeML).\n",
    "  * the **`Inventory`**/**`Station`**/**`Response`**/... classes handle station metadata (modelled after FDSN StationXML).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ..and the associated functions:\n",
    "  * The **`read`** function. Reads all kinds of waveform file formats. Outputs a **`Stream`** object.\n",
    "  * The **`read_events`** function. Reads QuakeML (and MCHEDR) files. Outputs a **`Catalog`** object.\n",
    "  * The **`read_inventory`** function. Reads FDSN StationXML files. Outputs an **`Inventory`** object.\n",
    "\n",

    "- **`read`**, **`read_events`** and **`read_inventory`** functions access the appropriate file-format submodule/plugin using filetype autodiscovery\n",
    "- `obspy.core.util` includes some generally useful utility classes/functions (e.g. for geodetic calculations, Flinn-Engdahl regions, ..)\n",
    "- some convenience command line scripts are also included (e.g. `obspy-plot`, `obspy-print`, `obspy-scan`, ..)\n",
