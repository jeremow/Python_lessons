    "\n",
    "- Open and write into a file: not really into _object-oriented_ stuff but I wanted to see that with you.\n",
    "- Apprehend classes and define properties : The really beginning of you being a master of Python ... After this you will conquer the world for sure\n",
    "- Specific methods: A class is not just methods and attributes, you can do a bit more (a lot more actually)\n",
    "- Inheritance: For small projects, a little bit useless but when you will write the whole Windows OS in Python in the last chapter ... (not true, don't panick!). It's a important notion in object-oriented programmation that you can find anywhere.\n",
