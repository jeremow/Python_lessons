# Python lessons

## Introduction to the Python Lessons

Lessons by [Jérémy Hraman](<mailto:cooperant.mongolie@iag.ac.mn>) (French cooperant at the Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics)

### Development

Each week, there will be a small lesson with different parts inside :

1. Questions about previous lessons/exercises (~15 minutes)
2. New lesson (~90 minutes)

And after a section is finished an exercise class.

I will give you other exercises to do outside of the lesson which are totally optional. It's only if you want to develop your experience in the Python world.
